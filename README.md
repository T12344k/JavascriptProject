Anagram finder

This project helps you find single word anagrams, whether by checking if two words are anagrams, if a sentence contains a specific anagram to a word or a group of anagrams within a sentence. 

TESTING THE CODE
You can test the endpoints for the following sections of the code.
The first function:
takes two words and checks if they are anagrams. 
you can test the code by giving it two single words and the function will return a boolean value whether the two words are anagrams or not. 
The second function:
can be tested by giving it a single word and a sentence. 
the function will output an array of anagrams of the single word in the sentence.
The third function:
Can be tested by giving it a string- for instance a sentence. 
the function will output an array of arrays of groups of anagrams in the string.
