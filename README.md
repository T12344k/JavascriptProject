Anagram finder

This project helps you find single word anagrams, whether by checking if two words are anagrams, if a sentence contains a specific anagram to a word or a group of anagrams within a sentence. 

TESTING THE CODE
You can test the endpoints for the following sections of the code.
The first function:
takes two words and checks if they are anagrams. 
you can test the code by giving it two single words and the function will return a boolean value whether the two words are anagrams or not. 
Example: 
If you give the function the following two words:
elvis, lives
the output will be true
If you would give it two words who are not anagrams, for instance:
ball, lab
the output will be false
The second function:
can be tested by giving it a single word and a sentence. 
the function will output an array of anagrams of the single word in the sentence.
For example: 
if the inputs will be 
chin
his chin was one inch long.
the output will be 
chin, inch because chin and inch are anagrams of chin, which was the single- word input. 
The third function:
Can be tested by giving it a  sentence. 
the function will output an array of arrays of groups of anagrams in the string. 
For example:
James cat can act and he bought a cheap peach. 
The output will be:
[["cat", "act"] ["cheap","peach"]]
each array represents a group of anagram in the sentence.
